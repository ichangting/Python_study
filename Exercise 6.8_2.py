'''
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is the largest number that divides
both of them with no remainder.
One way to find the GCD of two numbers is Euclidâ€™s algorithm, which is based on the observation
that if r is the remainder when a is divided by b, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r). 
As a base case, we can use gcd(a, 0) = a.

        return a
    else:
        r=a%b
        gcd(b,r)

a=int(raw_input('a='))
b=int(raw_input('b='))

if a<b:
    t=a
    a=b
    b=t 

print 'a=',a
